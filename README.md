# container-membership-benchmark
This repo contains code to test container (list, set, dict) membership.  Namely the "in" operator.

Run all benchmarks: $ ./runit.sh

Includes benchmarks for a list, set, frozenset and dict implementation.  This will execute using both the default python interpretor and pypy (if installed).
